# Mathematica for the Busy

_Mathematica_ is a scientific computing software that is utilized across almost all scientific fields as well as industry.  Here I have aggregated a few tools to hopefully help me in helping you to learn more about _Mathematica_, math, and how to keep moving forward in science.

## Mathematica for Constantly Busy

### [Full Version](https://github.com/NonDairyNeutrino/NonDairyNeutrino.github.io/blob/trunk/Mathematica%20for%20the%20Busy/Mathematica%20for%20the%20Constantly%20Busy/Mathematica%20for%20the%20Constantly%20Busy%203rd%20Edition.pdf)

For when you're constantly busy, but also want a more guided introduction into _Mathematica_, I have created just that. This version is meant to be read like a book, since it has commentary on sections and builds on what has come before, also with exercises at the end of each chapter, for which there are also [solutions](https://github.com/NonDairyNeutrino/NonDairyNeutrino.github.io/blob/trunk/Mathematica%20for%20the%20Busy/Mathematica%20for%20the%20Constantly%20Busy/Solutions/Solutions%20to%20Mathematica%20For%20The%20Constantly%20Busy.pdf).

For when you're really constantly busy, I have also made a short version.
