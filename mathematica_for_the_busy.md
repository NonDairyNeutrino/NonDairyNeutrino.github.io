# Mathematica for the Busy

_Mathematica_ is a scientific computing software that is utilized across almost all scientific fields as well as industry.  Here I have aggregated a few tools to hopefully help me in helping you to learn more about _Mathematica_, math, and how to keep moving forward in science.

## Mathematica for Constantly Busy

### [Full Version](https://github.com/NonDairyNeutrino/NonDairyNeutrino.github.io/blob/trunk/Mathematica%20for%20the%20Busy/Mathematica%20for%20the%20Constantly%20Busy/Mathematica%20for%20the%20Constantly%20Busy%203rd%20Edition.pdf)

For when you're constantly busy, but also want a more guided introduction into _Mathematica_, I have created just that. This version is meant to be read like a book, since it has commentary on sections and builds on what has come before, also with exercises at the end of each chapter, for which there are also [solutions](https://github.com/NonDairyNeutrino/NonDairyNeutrino.github.io/blob/trunk/Mathematica%20for%20the%20Busy/Mathematica%20for%20the%20Constantly%20Busy/Solutions/Solutions%20to%20Mathematica%20For%20The%20Constantly%20Busy.pdf).

For when you're really constantly busy, I have also made a short version.

## [Mathematica for the Mostly Busy](https://github.com/NonDairyNeutrino/NonDairyNeutrino.github.io/blob/trunk/Mathematica%20for%20the%20Busy/Mathematica%20for%20the%20Mostly%20Busy/Mathematica%20for%20the%20Mostly%20Busy.pdf)

In this second installment of the _Mathematica_ for the Busy series, we learn about more advanced topics both in math and _Mathematica_. A more in-depth look into the syntax is done to help further customize the code and make it do exactly what you want. On the math side, subjects including more derivatives, region integrals, Fourier Series/Transform, and Laplace Transform. For Linear Algebra, we very brief introduction to tensors is done and how to manipulate them in _Mathematica_. For Differential Equations, we will delve into the theory and application of partial differential equations and how they relate to topics already covered.

__Note__: This is is a work in progress, but I thought I could share what I have so far. I've created a skeleton outline of the overall piece, as can be seen by the numerous blank pages with only section headings. This work is subject to changes at any time. Also, as you can see by the date on the cover, I haven't update this document in some time, so there may be (as always) a few errors that of which I am not aware.

__Note__ 2: So far this book covers only the syntax and calculus sections.
