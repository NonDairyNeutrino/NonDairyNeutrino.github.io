# About Me

My name is Nathan Chapman. I graduated from Western Washington University with a Bachelor's of Science where I double majored in Physics and pure Mathematics. In that time at WWU, I researched with Dr. Brandon Peden into how the microscopic structure of molecules influences the many-body behavior/bulk properties of Bose-Einstein condensates of rigid-rotors. While I did love the work, my true passion lies in the theory of relativity. Over the passed year though, I've fallen in love with quantum mechanics and computational physics. From these, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in physics and hope to do something with computationally simulating quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Though, that's a long term plan. Aside from pure academia, I also love to communicate science to both technical, in the form of presenting at conferences, and non-technical audiences.
