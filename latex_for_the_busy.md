# LaTeX for the Busy

LaTeX is a of writing software that allows the professional presentation of scientific and technical information in an almost fully customizable fashion. It is the industry standard in producing technical reports, and has been used to write 800 page partial differential equations textbooks, to guides about LaTeX itself written by students. The latter is actually exactly what we have here.

Below is a guide to getting started with LaTeX.  It goes over essentials and even gives a few styling tips, as well as useful tools to make your documents have the full impact they deserve.  I have also provided an example document.
