## Introduction

I've done some stuff

## Research into Ultra-cold Quantum Gases

I researched with Dr. Brandon Peden at Western Washington University. My project was looking at how the microscopic structure of quadrupolar molecules affected the behavior of the many-body physics/larger system. Below are some summaries that I have written in my work.

On the right is a poster summarizing my work as of late May 2019. I presented this poster at the 2019 meeting of the Northwest Section of American Physical society, where I co-won Best Poster in the undergraduate division alongside fellow WWU physics student MacKenzie Jewell who was working with Dr. Janelle Leger. I also prepared and presented a talk (top left) on this research at the annual WWU Physics & Astronomy undergraduate research conference. On the bottom left is an introduction to the theory of the underlying quantum mechanics that went into this research.

## Phasors for the Constantly Busy

Here I have created a guide on phasors which includes basics complex numbers, and the representation of phasors and their application to electronic circuit analysis.

## Measuring Galaxy Cluster Masses with Gravitational Lensing

In the spring of 2016 in Astronomy 320: Cosmology at Western Washington University, I presented on measuring galaxy cluster masses with gravitational lensing.  Now I have provided it here for you.
